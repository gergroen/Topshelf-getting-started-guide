<h3>Introduction</h3>
For people that don't know what Topshelf is. <br />
<br />
<i>"Topshelf is a framework for hosting services written using the .NET framework. <br />
The creation of services is simplified, allowing developers to create a simple console application that can be installed as a service using Topshelf. <br />
The reason for this is simple: It is far easier to debug a console application than a service. <br />
And once the application is tested and ready for production, Topshelf makes it easy to install the application as a service."</i>
